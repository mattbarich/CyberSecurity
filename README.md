Reverse Engineering Projects
Here is some of my projects ive done with reverse engineering code. I find reverse engineering code to be similar to a puzzle.
There is always one peice that brings the whole puzzle or problem that brings it all together. Some of the tools that I 
learned to use while reverse engineering these problems was Ghidra and GDB. I really like Ghidra as it is very user 
friendly and I was able to map out the code better. GDB has helped me in almost every other class that I have taken or am taking.
I have gotten very good at using to debug my code when needed. I hope to expaned my knowledge and experiance with reverse engineering.
